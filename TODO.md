# TODO LIST
(Not necessarily in order)

# BUGS:
* Providing non-existant moca file to comiler frontend causes it to crash

# CLEANUP
* `_parse_variable` function inside `parser_create_variable.c` could use some cleanup, it's pretty messy

# TESTS:
* Update tests for parser_definition to check the correct `definition_type` enum (VARIABLE or FUNCTION)
* Write tests for `variable_t`, `function_t`, `parameter_t` and `global_scope_t`
* Add some more variable types and strings to the global variable tests

# CORE:
* Add global variables to data section (if initialized) or bss section (if uninitialized)
	* This currently works for strings, but not integer types
* Implement return values (`asm_functions.c`)
* Add line and char position information in `variable_t`, `function_t` and `parameter_t` which is used when encountering errors in `asm_functions.c`
* When fetching variable stack position, account for any parameters that don't fit in the first 6 registers (`asm_functions.c`)
* Check if variable name already exists (either parameter or local stack) when creating new variable inside function

# NICE TO HAVE:
* Hardcode the SPACE token inside the `token_is_valid` function in `parse_definition.c` so we don't have to add it to the list of expected tokens each time.
* Improve `err_write` to not have to provide the line and char pos, we can set them in the parsers. Would be more convenient to just write the message as in some cases we don't have line/char information (e.g., when writing tests)
* Display +/- 5 lines of the original source code in `err_print`
* Implement `err_writef` for printing formatted error messages
